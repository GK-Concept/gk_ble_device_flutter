This library enables the user to connect to a GK Concept device via Bluetooth Low
Energy (BLE), to discover devices in the proximity and to subscribe to the device's
report stream, notifying the application of the device's activity.

Currently, this library only supports Dropper devices with firmware 0.8.0 and later.
